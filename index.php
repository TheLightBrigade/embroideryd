      <h2>We Can Help You</h2>
      <p>We can help you create a logo or customized design with the right look to meet your needs; whether it is for a business, club, organization, team, or personal occasion. Whatever your design needs, we’re here to lend a hand. We can show off your embroidered and printed logo on a variety of items, including (but not limited to) apparel, firefighter work shirts, hats, leather items (like motorcycle seats), tack, banners, signs, and vehicle and window graphics. From christening gowns to horse blankets and pads, “Just Married” banners to magnetic vehicle signs, or one-of-a-kind T-shirts to team jerseys, we can fill your embroidery and imprinting needs. We also provide brand name and private label apparel.</p>
      
      <h2>Our Work is Done In-House</h2>
      <p>All of our embroidery, printing and imprinting are done in-house. We use state-of-the-art embroidery and graphic software to create your logo or design. Our embroidery is done on the best commercial embroidery machines, our printing on a 54” wide commercial printer/cutter, and imprinting with a digital heat press. We also offer silk-screening services. We’ll help you determine the best method for your budget and needs.</p>
      
      <h2>When We Work</h2>
      <p>We work seven days a week by appointment, offer same day service, and have no minimum orders for embroidery and most imprinted items.</p>
